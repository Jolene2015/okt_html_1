<h1 class="target point">Pepermint</h1>

<p style="background: aquamarine;color: darkblue"><strong>Pepermint</strong> (Mentha piperita, also known as Mentha balsamea Wild)[1] is a hybrid mint, a cross between watermint and spearmint.[2] Indigenous to Europe and the Middle East,[3] the plant is now widely spread and cultivated in many regions of the world.[4] It is occasionally found in the wild with its parent species.[4][5]

        Although the genus Mentha comprises more than 25 species, the one in most common use is peppermint.[6] While Western peppermint is derived from Mentha piperita, Chinese peppermint, or "Bohe", is derived from the fresh leaves of Mentha haplocalyx.[7][8][9] Mentha piperita and Mentha haplocalyx are both recognized as plant sources of menthol and menthone and are among the oldest herbs used for both culinary and medicinal products.</p>
